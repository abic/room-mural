Bedroom Mural
=============

This repository contains the SVG files for a mural I'd like to do in one of the rooms of my apartment.

My apartment has very tall ceilings and a picture handing railing that sits just more that 2 feet from the ceiling.
I thought it'd be fun to make a piece to cover this space.

The room is 8\' by ~12\' with a corner that's eaten up by stairs for the adjacent apartment.

Files [2](2.svg), [3](3.svg), and [4](4.svg) are for the 3 sections of wall where the stairs cut into the room and a conduit run up for the ceiling light.
